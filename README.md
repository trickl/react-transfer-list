Welcome to the repository for our Transfer List Componentâ€”a dynamic, user-friendly UI interface element designed for efficiently managing selections from a sizable set of options. This component enhances user interaction by allowing for an intuitive and visual shifting of items between two lists: available items and selected items. Users can easily select, filter, and move multiple items between these lists, providing a clear view of their choices at any given time.

## Why Use a Transfer List?

While both transfer lists and multi-select dropdowns serve the function of allowing users to make multiple selections, the transfer list offers several distinct advantages:

### Enhanced Usability
The transfer list component visually separates available options and selected items into two distinct columns, making it easier for users to review their selections. This separation is particularly useful when dealing with large numbers of choices, reducing the cognitive load on users and minimizing selection errors.

### Improved Interaction
Transfer lists support various operations such as filtering, searching, and sorting within each list, enhancing the user's ability to manage large sets of data effectively. This is a significant improvement over multi-select dropdowns, which can become cumbersome and difficult to navigate as the number of options grows.

### Better Organization
The dual-list format allows users to clearly see which items have been selected and which are still available, providing a more organized interface compared to the scrolling necessary in multi-select dropdowns. This organization is crucial in scenarios where clarity and precision of selection are important.

### Versatility and Flexibility
This component is versatile and can be easily adapted for different applications, supporting both simple and complex data structures. It is also highly customizable to fit the specific needs of your application, whether you need to adjust the layout, styling, or functionality.

Explore our repository to find out how the Transfer List Component can enhance your application's interface by providing a more structured, intuitive, and user-friendly selection mechanism. Happy coding!

### Usage

### TransferList

```<TransferList />``` is the top level component for holding lists that can exchange items.

```jsx
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react';
import { TransferList, TransferListList } from 'react-transfer-list';

const App = () => {
  const initialIds: Record<string, string[]> = {
    first: Array.from({ length: 10 }).map((_, i) => String(i + 1)),
  };
  const [ids, setIds] = useState(initialIds);

  const handleChange = useCallback((listId: string, ids: string[]) => {
    setIds((orig) => {
      orig[listId] = [...ids];
      return {...orig};
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <TransferList ids={ids} onChange={handleChange}>
      <TransferListList
        id="first"
        style={{ height: '100%', background: 'beige', margin: '10px' }}
      />
      <TransferListList
        id="second"
        style={{ height: '100%', background: 'aliceblue', margin: '10px' }}
      />
    </TransferList>
  );
};

```
### Adding buttons

To add buttons controlling behaviour, add click handlers to directly manipulate the ids.
For example, to transfer all items from one list to another, you could use the following click handler

```jsx
const transferAll = (from: string, to: string) => {
    handleChange(to, ids[from] ?? []);
    handleChange(from, []);
  }
```

<!-- props-table-start -->
#### Properties

| Property | PropType | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| ids | ```Record<string, string[]>``` | yes |  | The ids of the lists and the respective ids of each item in each list. |
| onChange | `` |  |  | Called when a request to change the items in a list is made. |

<!-- props-table-end -->

import { ReorderableList } from 'react-transfer-list';

const App = () => {
  const [ids, setIds] = useState<string[]>(['1', '2', '3']);
  const handleChange = useCallback((ids: string[]) => {
    setIds(ids);
  }, []);
  return <ReorderableList ids={ids} onChange={handleChange} />;
};
